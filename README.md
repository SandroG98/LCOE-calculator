# LCOE-calculator

A small python script that calculates the LCOE of a power plant. The necessary data of the power plant must be entered in main.py. The function.py file contains following functions:

-crf(interest, years)
    Calculates the capital recovery factor
-fcost(invest, crf, other, T)
    Calculates the fixed costs
-fuel(cost, hw, etha)
    Calculates the fuel costs
-co2price(co2, emissionf, etha)
    Calculates the costs of the emitted co2
-vcost(co2c, fc, other=0)
    Calculates the variable costs
-lcoe(costfix, costvariable)
    calculates the levelized cost of electricity for the power plant
